- I had already installed VScode on my computer for a previous class, so I did not have to go through the installation process.

Logging into server:

- We were unable to connect to the CSE15L server this lab because of issues with the server login itself. However, we instead used our regular school logins to access these files.
In order to login we had to enter "ssh (uniqueusername)@ieng6.ucsd.edu" and then you put in your unique passworld once it asks for it.

Testing out commands:

-The commands I tried today were "ls -a", "ls -lat", and "cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt". The first command shows all the commands being run in the directory, 
and the second command lists all the possible commands that can be used in the directory. The final command accesses the hello.txt text file and prints the contents of it, 
which is "Hello!"

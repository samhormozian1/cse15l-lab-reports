Part 2 (Reflection)

- Something I learned that I didn't know before during the second half of this quarter were how to use vim and nano to go through files and add, remove, or edit them. I never really knew that you were able to do so many things through just the terminal by using git bash and other 
things we learned. I also learned a lot about being able to work effectively with others during my actual labs, since there were times where I actually didn't know how to do something and asking for help was the only option.
